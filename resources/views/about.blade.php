                        The Contracts Renewal System, hereinafter called the system, was developed to make the operations of the contracts office much easier. It was noticed that employees often delay to renew their contracts or even take long to start the renewal process. With this system we expect that employees will be reminded on time to start the renewal process and will make the works of the contracts officer easier.

                        It's important to note that this system is not a human resource system rather a supplement to it.<br><br>
                        The Contract renewal system was developed by two computer science Lecturers and four students namely Mr.Phiri,Mr. Sinkala, Manaseh Mwansa, Martin Chileshe, Richard Mwaba and David Bwembya respectively.
